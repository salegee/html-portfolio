 <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
 <p><em>In no particular order. These are simply
    the movies that I always think of when someone
    asks me what my favorite movies are.</em>

 <h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>

 <p><em><strong>Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi</strong></em><br><br>
A peculiar, bitter-sweet love story about how our perspective and
memories define how we experience love. </p>
 <h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</h3>

 <p>
   <strong><em>Romance, Comedy, Coming of Age, Comic Book</em></strong> <br><br>
A silly, fun, coming of age teen romance that 
reminds me of my high school years as a dumb 
teenager before learning that love means huring others when 
you don't love yourself.
 </p>
 <h3>Hereditary</h3>

 <p>
    <strong><em>Psychological, Horror, Supernatural, Drama</em></strong><br><br>
If you've had to grow with a dysfunctional family as a result of trauma and mental health issues, this horror
story will grab a hold of your anxiety from beginning to end, and remind you that
the true horror comes not from literal demons, but from the 
ones closest to you, including yourself. </p>
